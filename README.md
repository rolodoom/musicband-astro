## 📁 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.svg
│   └── images/
│       └── cover.png
├── src/
│   └── components/
│       └── BaseHead.astro
│   └── layout/
│       └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│       └── 404.astro
│   └── styles/
│       └── global.css
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🔧 Configuration

### SEO Configuration

The template includes a `BaseHead.astro` component that handles all SEO-related meta tags. It supports:

- Title and description meta tags
- Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card meta tags
- Canonical URL
- Favicon

### Astro config:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://example.com/", // Replace with your own URL
});
```

🔧 Replace `"https://example.com/"` with your site’s URL before deploying.

### Tailwind Configuration

Tailwind CSS is pre-configured and ready to use. Customization can be done through the Astro configuration file (`astro.config.mjs`).
